"For the synthesis of titanyl nitrate solution, 2 mL (∼6.52 mmol) of titanyl isopropoxide (Ti(i-OPr)4) was transferred in 20 mL ice cooled distilled water and white colored TiO(OH)2 was precipitated due to hydrolysis. Dilute HNO3 (10 mL) was added to it and white precipitate got dissolved leading to a colorless solution of TiO(NO3)2. in 10 mL of distilled water. Both solutions were mixed and 2.5 mL (∼21.4 mmol) of DETA was added to it. The solution turned into white colored gel. The gel was kept under sonication (Oskar O U 9 equipped with high intensity piezoelectric ultrasonic probe, 30 ± 3 KHz, 100 W/cm2O) for 8 h. Temperature of solution reached to 75°C during sonication. The precipitated solid was filtered and dried in hot air oven at 120°C for 3 h."
